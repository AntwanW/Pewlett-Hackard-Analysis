# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

This analysis aims to prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami" that will hit the company as many employees retire; first, determine the number of employees who are retiring per title. Then, you'll write a report detailing your findings and recommendations.


## Results:

Pewlett-Hackard included only employees born between 1952 and 1955 in the calculation. This means that those born between these years will be retiring soon, and current employees born in 1965 are qualified to be mentors in the Mentorship Program.

## Summary:

Due to the retirement of over 133,776 employees, Pewlett-Hackard will have to prepare for the loss of over 29,415 Senior Engineers and 34,559 Engineers. This will have a significant impact on the company's future.

Only 1,549 employees are eligible to participate in the company's mentorship program. If one of these employees were to train a group of new employees, they would have to mentor many unique individuals. This is a large group of people, and it would be tough to find mentors. The company could expand the program's eligibility to include more employees.
